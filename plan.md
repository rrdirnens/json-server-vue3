## Steps

[DONE] 
- Add routing (Home -> reg/login -> dashboard)


[TO-BE-DONE]
- Remove and store all authentication things(don't actually delete). Develop the interesting parts (tracking and displaying metrics), not authentication shit, which is a backend thing anyway.
- Add first binary metric to track manually (counter++ on every action). The metric being track will be determined by user input: the user adds the name of the metric and determins what each unit represents. For example, the user clicks the button every time he has smoked a pack of cigarettes. 
- Create a way of storing the metric in the database
